TODO
====

* Test on iOS and android phones and tablets - in particular, test out: 
  * touch stuff: "touchStarted(), touchMoved(), touchX, touchY, etc
  * sound
  * networking (firebase)
  * device orientation and acceleration

* TODO: find how to refer to a fn in another prototype?  
  e.g. ops.forEach(killOscSoftly); rather than saying
       ops.forEach(function(op){ op.killOscSoftly(); } );

* allow drag of an existing placed pitch.
