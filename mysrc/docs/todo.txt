TODO
====

* Test on iOS and android phones and tablets - in particular, test out: 
  * touch stuff: "touchStarted(), touchMoved(), touchX, touchY, etc
  * sound
  * networking (firebase)
  * device orientation and acceleration

* TODO: find how to refer to a fn in another prototype?  
  e.g. ops.forEach(killOscSoftly); rather than saying
       ops.forEach(function(op){ op.killOscSoftly(); } );

* allow drag of an existing placed pitch.

* add a snap() fn to tune all the higher freq notes to some accepted ratio of the lowest note's freq (perhaps).

* allow the note-balls to fall and bounce, acted upon by gravity and collisions, their params changing as that happens.  (perhaps use the play.j5 library for that).

* find the right way to test for null vals in js. ugh.

* stop click on snapshot restore.

* consider using own pool of oscs if they don't behave on initial creation / culling.
