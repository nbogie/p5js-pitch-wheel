notes:

* processing functions such as color(i, i, i) don't exist outwith setup or other.

* touchX and touchY seem to be floating point values (on android chrome, at least).
* touchX, touchY and touches[0] are not equivalent.  touchX and touchY will remain set to their last values even when touches[] has size zero (i.e. no touch is taking place).


* call native canvas stuff directly if necessary using the variable drawingContext: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview

* define touchStarted(), etc, and have them return false, to prevent default browser panning behaviour, etc.  From: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview
