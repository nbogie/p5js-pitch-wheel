TODO
====

* Test on iOS and android phones and tablets - in particular, test out: 
  * touch stuff: "touchStarted(), touchMoved(), touchX, touchY, etc
  * sound
  * networking (firebase)
  * device orientation and acceleration

* TODO: find how to refer to a fn in another prototype?  
  e.g. ops.forEach(killOscSoftly); rather than saying
       ops.forEach(function(op){ op.killOscSoftly(); } );

* allow drag of an existing placed pitch.

* add a snap() fn to tune all the higher freq notes to some accepted ratio of the lowest note's freq (perhaps).

* allow the note-balls to fall and bounce, acted upon by gravity and collisions, their params changing as that happens.  (perhaps use the play.j5 library for that).

* find the right way to test for null vals in js. ugh.

* stop click on snapshot restore.

* consider using own pool of oscs if they don't behave on initial creation / culling.

* make it work offline again. (no dependencies on firebase or CDNs for the jquery and firebase js, etc)

* x,y values restored from a snapshot are specific to the window dimensions under which they were snapshotted, and do not reflect how high or low a pitch really is.  If the window had height 100, a bass note might be y: 90, but this is very high up when restored on an 800px window.  snapshot should save x and y as fractional values, from 0 to 1.

* allow anyone to enter a colourlovers url and have the ui take on that palette (so they can build their palettes with those tools). they should also be able to capture an output string representing the palette and its assignments, once they've finished shuffling to fit.

* todo, impl 
var walkdownCtrl = wheel.makeWalkdown()
walkdownCtrl.step()
walkdownCtrl.step()
For any chord this step it down one note at a time.  (it has state - the last note moved of the chord).

* try the solarized palette: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#features
